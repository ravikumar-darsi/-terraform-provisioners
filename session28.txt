Provisioners:

There are 2 types of Provisioners
1. local_exec  --> it will where you're terraform command(like your laptop)

2. remote_exec  --> this will run inside the server

Provisioners are useful to integrate terraform with configuration management tools like ansible

Here, terraform respoblility is to create the server
server creation ----> infra creation(terraform)
server configuration --> configuration management (ansible)

creation -time --> this local_exec will run when server is created
destroy time --> at the time of destroy command


remote_exec
---------
1. first you should connect to the server
2. then you can run anything inside the server.
